When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Collaborating with other people working on other computers. Having a backup on the remote server.

    Fork: clones an exisiting repo on github to my github account
    clone: clones a repository to my machine
    branches: branches are used to create a different version of my project in a repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
